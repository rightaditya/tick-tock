TICK-TOCK is an alarm clock for those that really have trouble getting up.  I've tried multiple alarms, music, alarms placed around the apartment, and various other techniques and no matter what I always just turn off the alarm(s) and go back to sleep.  TICK-TOCK is meant to solve this problem by using weight sensors and an Internet calendar to constantly make some noise at a given time if the user is detected as being in bed.

This project is done by Aditya Bhargava and Freeman Fan for the CMPE 490 project at the University of Alberta.  The code will initially be for the microcontroller board provided for the course (the AT91M5880A), but during the summer (hopefully) the code will be archived and the project "rebooted" for a different (most likely Linux-based) embedded system.  The former part for the project will not be for actual use, as there will not be any housing for the alarm, but the latter will (eventually) be intended for use and configurable via e.g. SSH.

#summary Work log for Aditya for March 19, 2009.

  * Wiring the LEDs on the Ethernet module causes problems, so forget that.  I also had a strange issue where I couldn't get it to work correctly unless I hooked up a probe on the chip select line.  I've emulated this with a 10MOhm resistor and a 100pF capacitor.  This is a short-term solution.
  * Moved the weight sensors from ADC0 to ADC1.  Channels 1 and 2 on ADC0 seem to be bad.  The sensors have been tested and are working correctly.  A function has been written to determine whether or not the alarm should be active (from the weight sensors' perspective) given lower and upper thresholds, which are determined by calibration.

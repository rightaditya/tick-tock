#summary Work log for Freeman for April 1, 2009.
#labels Log

    * I was able to compile the ticktock user interface program in a FLASH compatible format. Flashing the program onto the Atmel board was quick and painless, and worked on first try. However, a problem occurred. Buttons don't work anymore. It seems I have lost the touch functionality of the LCD screen.
    * Tomorrow I need to fix this loss of touch functionality.

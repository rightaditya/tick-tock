  * We're not doing eCos.
  * Got the weight sensors and the op amp IC (33174).
  * Got the speaker (8 ohm) and a 555 IC.
  * The weight sensor circuit is set up and working correctly (as far as we can tell).
  * The speaker circuit is set up and working correctly.  For some reason adjusting the voltage changes the frequency, but whatever.

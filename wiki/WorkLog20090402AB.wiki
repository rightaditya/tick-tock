#summary Work log for Aditya for April 2, 2009.
#labels Log

  * NTP is working to time.srv.ualberta.ca.  Google communication is working.  However, the Wiznet's working at all is contingent on the use of Kienan and Dave's PCB.  I did extensive testing with various combinations of parts and in the end, I determined that the difference _must_ be due to our wiring vs. their PCB.  I'm not sure why the crappy testing that I did with their free PCB didn't yield success; their PCB works fine with our module and hooked up to our board (address, data, and control lines).  I'm not sure what the best way is to handle this, but if they're willing to part ways with their free PCB then it may be worth trying to solder that up for use.  They do have 2x 0.1uF capacitors on the 3.3V line, so I will test out adding those, but I don't believe they'll have any effect.
  * In terms of code, we just need to tie everything together and get it working in flash (and also modularize the code a bit and make it nicer).
  * Tomorrow (or rather, later today...), I need to ask Nancy about using 3.3V to switch a 5V signal.  The speaker is not loud enough (and is a tad unstable), but we get both loudness and stability if we use 5V to pass the signal.

#summary Work log for Aditya for March 23, 2009.
#labels Log

  * Got the router from Nancy and have it hooked up.  With my laptop connected to it I can ping the Ethernet module.
  * Getting DNS replies (had problems earlier, forgot to convert to big endian for the network).  Next step is to compare the received message that I get from identical DNS requests on the laptop and on the Ethernet module, since the response I get on the Wiznet seems to be mangled.

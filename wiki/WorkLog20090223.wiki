  * Tried to get the Ethernet module working.  Spent a long time on it and in the end it was because we forgot to get a proper common ground!
  * Got a 3.3V regulator.  Hooked it up and tested it; it's working fine.  We will still need one for -5V though.
  * Put a transistor between the 555 and power; it's switched by DA0.
  * Hooked up the Ethernet module reset pins to one reset switch.  We needed one inverter for this.  Reset seems to be working correctly.

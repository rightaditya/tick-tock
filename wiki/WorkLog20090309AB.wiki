#summary Work log for Aditya for March 9, 2009.
#labels Log

  * Haven't gotten anywhere with the Ethernet.  It detects the connection but I can't get it to initialize properly (for next time).  Once that is done, we will need to write a DNS & HTTP stack as well as an ICS parser.
  * I messed around with the ADCs.  I have working code, but I don't really understand what's going on.  For one, while I have the weight sensors set up to work on a 0-5V range, Nancy tells me that ADVREF is set internally to something like 2.5V.  When I read the target voltage with a multimeter, I get ~1.68V or so, and this increases with pressure (I got it up to around 2V by pressing really hard on the sensor against the table).  The ADC value I get is ~670 for no pressure and ~620 for with pressure, so I don't quite understand what the ADC output signifies.  Next time, I will need to either figure out what kind of values it gives (and why they decrease with increasing voltage) or else simply test the target values (nothing, empty chair, occupied chair) to make sure they are separable enough.  I'll start with the former and if I don't get somewhere fast enough I'll switch to the latter; in this case, the issue may become how to increase the range so that the ADC output can give more sensitive values.

#summary Info for interfacing the Ethernet module.

= Basic connection information =
The Ethernet module is used via the EBI of the board; we use chip select 2.  It uses an eight-bit data bus and a 15-bit address bus, so we use D0-D7 on the EBI for data and A1-A15 for the address.  NWR0, NRD, and NCS2 are used for WR, RD, and CS.

= Register values =
DBW = 10 (EBI_DBW_8)

NWS = 001 (EBI_NWS_2) - testing will show if we need to increase this

PAGES = 00 (EBI_PAGES_1M)

TDF = 001 (EBI_TDF_1)

BAT = 0 (EBI_BAT_BYTE_WRITE) - I was never sure about this, but it should be right

BA = 0x100 (Base address is 0x10000000)

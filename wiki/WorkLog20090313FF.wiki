#labels Log

    * I completed writing the graphics library for drawing on the LCD
    * I also implemented a simple user interface for displaying the current date, time, temperature and next scheduled alarm on the LCD, as well as a simple navigation bar
    * I implemented the light toggle button on the navigation bar, which is used to turn on and off the LCD light
    * Next time I will polish up the user interface as well as look in how to work with the real time clock of the board

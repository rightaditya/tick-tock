#summary Info for interfacing the NVRAM.

= Basic connection information =
The NVRAM is used via the EBI of the board; we use chip select 3.  It uses an eight-bit data bus and a 21-bit address bus, so we use D0-D7 on the EBI for data and A1-A21 for the address.  NWR0, NRD, and NCS3 are used for WR, RD, and CS.

= Register values =

DBW = 10 (EBI_DBW_8)

NWS = 010 (EBI_NWS_6) - testing will show if we need to increase this; the W3100A gives max tCO and tOE of 73ns for direct mode and 81 ns for indirect mode); furthermore, the internal clocked mode of the Ethernet module is for access times >= 100ns

PAGES = 01 (EBI_PAGES_4M)

TDF = 001 (EBI_TDF_1)

BAT = 0 (EBI_BAT_BYTE_WRITE) - I was never sure about this, but it should be right

BA = 0x200 (Base address is 0x20000000)

= Pin diagram =
TODO if we feel like it

= Testing =
Seems to be working correctly.  Had to increase NWS from 3 to 6.

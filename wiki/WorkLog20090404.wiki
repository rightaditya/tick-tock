#summary Work log for April 3, 2009.
#labels Log

  * Touch was fixed (problem was due to invalid RTC settings) but then broke again, and then fixed again (again, RTC issues because Freeman doesn't know where to look).
  * Timezone problem fixed.
  * Weight sensors are set up.
  * Synchronizing is being done on the hour, every hour.
  * Alarms are being read properly, but there still isn't an eight-hour buffer.
  * So we still need to:
    * Fix touch (most works, but when entering in a new username it crashes)
    * fix next alarm display
    * test alarms
    * fix timezone update
    * Add an eight-hour buffer period for all syncs except the first so that any calendar changes before eight hours from sync time are ignored - and the user should be allowed to change the timezone but this can't be allowed to affect when the alarm will go off (if it was originally going to occur within the next eight hours)
    * Fix the date (12 AM incorrectly displays as 12 PM - I've hardcoded the time so that it is set to a 12AM-range time)
    * Get the program into flash
    * Write the report
    * Get the presentation done and plan the demo

#summary Work log for April 3, 2009.
#labels Log

  * Touch was fixed (problem was due to invalid RTC settings) but then broke again.
  * Timezone problem fixed.
  * Weight sensors are set up.
  * Synchronizing is being done on the hour, every hour.
  * Alarms are being read properly, but there still isn't an eight-hour buffer.
  * So we still need to:
    * Fix touch
    * Fix the date (12 AM incorrectly displays as 12 PM - I've hardcoded the time so that it is set to a 12AM-range time)
    * Get the program into flash
    * Write the report
    * Get the presentation done and plan the demo

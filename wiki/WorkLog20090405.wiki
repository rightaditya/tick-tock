#labels Log

  * Implemented the eight-hour buffer.
  * Implemented scrolling status text on sync screen.
  * Freeman was unable to reproduce touch problems.
  * Tested everything to make sure it all works in RAM.
  * Our regulators get quite hot.  They were left running for too long, and it looks like the Ethernet module is fried.  Everything else seems to work, however (we individually tested all components).
  * Finished the report.

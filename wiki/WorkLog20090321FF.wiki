#summary Work log for Freeman for March 21, 2009.
#labels log

    * Figured out how to use the real time clock
    * I was able to set the current time to the RTC and read from it, and subsequently display a ticking clock on the LCD screen
    * I was also able to set the current date and read the date, and display date information on the LCD
    * Function frameworks are written for syncing with date and time information on the Internet
    * Next time I need to polish up these frameworks and include temperature reading and displays, as well as to implement the keyboard system

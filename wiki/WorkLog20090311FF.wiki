    * I tested the new LCD control functions and verified that they work well with the LCD module. I was able to send commands to the LCD such as clear screen, set color and draw boxes. I started building graphics functions for creating a user interface.
    * Next time I will complete building the graphics library for drawing a user interface on the LCD screen. If time permits, I will also test the touch functionality of the LCD module.
